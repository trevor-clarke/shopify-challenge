Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question

## Initial Notes:
It is very funny that this was the challenge outlined! A year or two ago, I wanted an Instagram-alternative for displaying my photography.
Since I already owned several personal domains, it only made sense to make a system that worked with the rest of my webiste.

## My Approach 
Rather than reprogramming the entire things, for demonstrational puposes, I am going to walk through some key challenges, and how I solved them (with snippits of code from my server).

## Live Demo
A live demo of this system can be found on my website at: (TrevorClarke.ca/photography)[https://TrevorClarke.ca/photography]
